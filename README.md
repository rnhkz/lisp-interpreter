# Lisp Interpreter

This is a interpreter for a programming language, a minimal lisp. It is being made by following the guide in [this book](https://buildyourownlisp.com/chapter1_introduction#about). The chapter is organized by having the work for each chapter in it's own folder, with build instructions included in a readme. This is a WIP - I plan to add more onto it in the future.
